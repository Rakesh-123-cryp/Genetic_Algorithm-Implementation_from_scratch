# Genetic_Algorithm-Implementation
The Genetic algorithm is applied on ANN with multiple layers. Classes and functions created from scratch using python.

The InputLayer and Dense layers available in Tensorflow is replicated and applied to satisfy the optimization's flow. This is created by a UG graduate and will be updated in the upcoming months to make it more effecient and usable by all

Accuracy ~ 93% due to the high computation required for the algorithm it takes plenty of time to perform optimization on large dataset. Hence requires massive gpu and cpu to compute.
